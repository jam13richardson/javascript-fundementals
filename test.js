// Just printing a literal string
console.log('Hello there');

// Declaring a new variable `age`
age = 25;

// We can concatenate strings with variables using the + operator
console.log('I am ' + age + 'years old');

// Assigning a new value
age = 27;
console.log('I am now ' + age + 'years old!');

//  most often, will not need to change value of variable so "const" is perfect, error occurs if try to change variable 

// The console.log() method is a useful tool for debugging and testing code in JavaScript. When used correctly, it can help you understand how your code is running and catch errors or unexpected behavior.

// Here are some benefits of using console.log() in JavaScript:

// Debugging: You can use console.log() to print out the value of a variable, object, or expression at a specific point in your code. This can help you verify that your code is working as expected and identify any issues that need to be addressed.

// Logging: console.log() can be used to log important information or events that occur during the execution of your code. This can be helpful for tracking user interactions or debugging issues that occur in production.

// Performance monitoring: You can use console.time() and console.timeEnd() to measure the time it takes for specific parts of your code to execute. This can help you identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code for better performance.

// Testing: console.log() can be used to test specific conditions or scenarios in your code. By printing out values or objects at different points in your code, you can verify that your code is functioning as expected and that all conditions are being met.

// Overall, console.log() is a versatile and valuable tool for developers working with JavaScript. It can help you write better code, identify and fix issues more quickly, and improve the overall performance of your applications.
